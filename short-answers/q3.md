# Question 3

Who sends the HTTP status code: the client or the server? What is the point of the status code?

# Answer
The server sends the HTTP status code. Codes in the 200 range indicate that everything is working fine. The status code, provided in the response object, helps us understand the progress and outcome of our HTTP request.
