# Question 6

`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - This property returns a boolean based on whether the response status code falls within the successful 200-299 range (`true`) or not (`false`).

2. `Response.status` - This property returns the response's numerical HTTP status code, providing information on how the request was processed and clues on any errors.

3. `Response.url` - This property returns the URL we made our request to, useful for verification purposes.

4. `Response.headers` - This property contains a `Headers` object with metadata about the response. It can include things such as `content-type`, `authorization`, and `content-length`, etc.
