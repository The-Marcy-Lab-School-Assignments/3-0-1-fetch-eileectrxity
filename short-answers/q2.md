# Question 2

What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer
The **Request/Response Cycle** represents web communication over HTTP protocol; it describes the interaction between a **client** (us/our web browsers) and a **server** (an application hosting content we want to access).

The way it works is that the client makes a `request` to the server, and the server processes this request and returns a `response`.

**Step 1**: The client initiates the request by specifying the `URL` it wishes to query, the `HTTP method` to use, and any optional `headers` or `body`. For instance, a GET request asks for data, while a POST request sends data to the server.

**Step 2**: The server receives and processes this request, performing the necessary operations (like querying a database or processing data). It then returns a `response` object or an error message to the client. An instance of the Response prototype object, the response sent contains properties with data such as `response.ok`, `response.status`, and the `body` with the requested data as a readable stream. This is then sent back to the client, where it is processed further and rendered accordingly.

The details of this interaction can be observed in the Network tab of the browser's Developer Tools, where you can see the request URL, HTTP method, status code, and response headers. In inspecting the request headers, developers can debug, verify authentication tokens, or check response status codes, for example, to handle any errors in their application.

This cycle is what enables dynamic user interactions and data exchange between clients and servers over the internet.
